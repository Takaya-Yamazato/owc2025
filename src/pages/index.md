# Workshop description

<p align="justify">
Optical wireless communication (OWC) systems have gained considerable attention for their potential in terrestrial, space, and underwater communication links. Recognized as cost-effective, sustainable, and energy-efficient solutions, OWC is well-positioned to meet the increasing demands for capacity and quality in Beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G networks. Notably, high-power solid-state laser diodes are emerging as key enablers for medium to long-range applications. Meanwhile, semiconductor sources such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in visible and ultraviolet wavelengths, along with multi-array light sources and advanced tracking technologies, are advancing the potential for short to medium-range wireless communication.<p>
<p align="justify">
OWC systems show promise not only for terrestrial use but also for Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs), such as satellite communication. These networks leverage the unique capabilities of OWC for high-speed, high-capacity links that surpass traditional radio frequency methods. However, challenges remain, primarily due to optical beam propagation's vulnerability to atmospheric conditions, weather-related distortions, and the need for integration with existing RF networks. These factors complicate the design and deployment of OWC systems in diverse environments. Addressing these challenges requires ongoing research into OWC channel models, system components, and the development of innovative techniques for improved performance. This effort is vital for advancing the adoption of OWC systems across various domains. <p>

# Learning objectives

<p align="justify">
With the ever-growing demand for enhanced capacity and quality in wireless communication links, researchers have continually sought innovative design methodologies and concepts to develop wireless systems and networks toward the 6G era. OWC technologies have emerged as promising enablers for flexible, high-capacity communication systems, particularly for B5G/6G, aerospace, and internet of things (IoT) applications. In fact, the current radio frequency (RF) spectrum is no longer sufficient to meet the exponential increase of the physical devices connected to the internet as well as the high capacity backhaul connectivity required by B5G communications. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
OWC technologies includes several research derivatives, such as free-space optical (FSO) communications, visible light communications (VLC), ultraviolet (UV) communications, Light fidelity (LiFi) technology, optical camera communications (OCC), and underwater OWC (UOWC). These technologies cater to a range of scenarios, from terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) to underwater environments.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Advancements in optical sources, such as the transition from bulky solid-state laser diodes (LDs) to compact, energy-efficient light-emitting diodes (LEDs) across infrared, visible, and ultraviolet spectra, have driven the rapid growth of OWC systems. These systems enable diverse applications, including OCC, which utilize optical image sensors in devices like smartphones and vehicle cameras for IoT, indoor localization, motion capture, and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). VLC extends beyond traditional data transfer to provide localization and positioning services.
In vehicular networks, OWC supports collision avoidance and traffic management, while UV OWC links offer covert, license-free communication with minimal orientation requirements. LiFi technology delivers high-speed, secure, and energy-efficient connectivity for indoor internet access, smart lighting, and IoT. FSO systems, with fiber-like data rates at lower deployment costs, serve as critical interconnect technologies for terrestrial and NTNs. OWC is pivotal in NTNs, enabling high-capacity, secure communication in satellite-to-ground and inter-satellite links. Additionally, UOWC provides affordable, high-bandwidth connectivity for submarine applications, addressing the increasing demand for underwater data transmission.
